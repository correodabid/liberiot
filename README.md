# LIBERiot
## Wireless iot freedom

LIBERiot is the real alternative to all those expensive proprietary IoT wireless solutions. Unlike Sigfox or LoRa, LIBERiot is based on very low-cost infrastructure and motes. LIBERiot can also be scaled-up very easily due to the natural flexibility of the protocols and the simplicity of the gateways.

#### WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE

LIBERiot relies on the open community for deploying the wireless infrastructure. This community provides the Internet connectivity and the very low-cost wireless gateways, making the network totally global, open and free for the community.

#### THE GATEWAY

LIBERiot gateways redirect low-power wireless traffic coming from the motes (sensors and actuators) to the MQTT broker-server running in the cloud. These gateways are based on popular low-cost hardware modules.

#### THE MOTES

LIBERiot compatible motes can be made from low-cost radios and microcontrollers. Of course, we sell gateways and devices, but they can also be made from a wide variety of wireless hardware modules.

#### THE RADIO

LIBERiot's official wireless protocol is GWAP. Global Wireless Abstract Protocol is used between motes and gateways to transport sensor and actuator information. Wireless devices and gateways can transmit at any of the following frequency ranges:

430-435 MHz
863-873 MHz
902-928 MHz

Being all frequencies below 1 GHz, long communication distances can be achieved, typically between 0.5 and 5 Km in open spaces depending on lign of sight and transmission power. Another good thing about GWAP is that it can be implemented on almost any low-power/low-cost radio.

#### THE SERVER

The key behind LIBERiot is the server and our wireless motes and gateways. The server processes all the wireless packets coming from the gateways and converts them into readable information, ready to be exploited by our community.

#### OPEN HARDWARE

LIBERiot is open so everyone can make wireless devices compatible with our motes and redirect the wireless traffic to their own servers. LIBERiot makes extensive use of open technologies like Arduino, Linux and open protocols such as MQTT and GWAP.
